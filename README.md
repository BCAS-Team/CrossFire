CrossFire v4.0 - BlackBase (Release)
The Universal Package Management Revolution
One Command. Every Platform. Total Control.
</div>

💡 What is CrossFire?
CrossFire is a universal package manager that unifies your entire software ecosystem under a single, intelligent command-line interface. Built in Python, it automates the detection, installation, and management of packages across multiple platforms and ecosystems.

Say goodbye to managing pip, npm, apt, brew, winget, and dozens of others. With CrossFire, one simple command is all you need.

🚀 Key Features
Intelligent Manager Selection: CrossFire automatically detects your operating system, architecture, and installed managers, then intelligently selects the optimal tool for the job.

Unified Command Arsenal: Use the same commands to install, remove, and update packages, regardless of the underlying package manager.

Comprehensive Coverage: Seamlessly manages packages from over a dozen ecosystems, including pip, npm, apt, dnf, pacman, brew, winget, chocolatey, snap, and flatpak.

Performance Engineered: Leverages concurrent operations and smart caching to speed up installations and updates.

Self-Sustaining Architecture: A single-file, dependency-free deployment that can self-update, ensuring you're always running the latest version.

🛠️ Quick Start
Installation
The easiest way to get started is with the one-liner setup script. This script downloads, installs, and configures CrossFire on your system.

# Download, install, and configure CrossFire
curl -o crossfire.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BCAS-Team/CrossFire/main/CrossFireL/crossfire.py && chmod +x crossfire.py && python crossfire.py --setup

The --setup command performs the following operations:

PATH Integration: Installs the crossfire.py launcher to a user-local bin directory (~/.local/bin or similar) and adds it to your system's PATH.

Shell Configuration: Automatically detects your shell (.bashrc, .zshrc, .fish) and adds the necessary configuration to make the crossfire command available.

Windows Integration: Creates a .bat launcher for a seamless experience on Windows.
